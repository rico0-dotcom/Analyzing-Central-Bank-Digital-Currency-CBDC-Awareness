CBDC Awareness and Adoption Research
This repository presents a comprehensive research project on public perception, awareness, and willingness to adopt Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The study uses statistical and machine learning tools in Python to analyze survey data collected as part of a college-level research methodology course
Methodology
Data Collection: Survey responses (Likert-scale, multiple choice)

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, label-encoded categorical data

Statistical Analysis:

T-test: Gender vs CBDC willingness

Pearson Correlation: Trust in govt. vs willingness

Regression: Awareness & education â†’ adoption likelihood

Chi-square Test: Education vs adoption categories

Tools Used: pandas, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn
Key Findings
No significant gender difference in CBDC adoption (p > 0.05)

Positive correlation (r = 0.35) between trust in CBDC security and willingness to adopt

Awareness significantly predicts lower willingness to use CBDC (possibly due to skepticism)

Education level showed no significant categorical effect on adoption likelihood
Limitations
Sample size: n = 79, may not fully generalize

Self-reported responses may involve bias

Assumes Likert scales are interval-level for parametric tests

Trust and awareness variables may be context-sensitive
